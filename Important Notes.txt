Interview Questions:
	Hash Tables are the most useful/common technique for solving interview problems. They should be 
	your starting point when looking to solve a question.
Basic Operations:
	Search:
		Searches an element in a hash table: O(1).
	Insert:
		Inserts an element in a hash table: O(1).
	Delete:
		Deletes an element from a hash table: O(1).
Assumed Runtimes:
	All operations are assumed to perform in O(1) time but could potentially run in O(n) time if 
	using a bad hashing technique.
